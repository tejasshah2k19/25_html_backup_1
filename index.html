        Football is a family of team sports that involve, to varying degrees, kicking a ball to score a goal.
        Unqualified,
        the word football generally means the form of football that is the most popular where the word is used. Sports
        commonly called football include association football (known as soccer in Australia, Canada, South Africa, the
        United States, and sometimes in Ireland and New Zealand); Australian rules football; Gaelic football; gridiron
        football (specifically American football, arena football, or Canadian football); International rules football;
        rugby
        league football; and rugby union football.[1] These various forms of football share, to varying degrees, common
        origins and are known as "football codes".

        There are a number of references to traditional, ancient, or prehistoric ball games played in many different
        parts
        of the world.[2][3][4] Contemporary codes of football can be traced back to the codification of these games at
        English public schools during the 19th century, itself an outgrowth of medieval football.[5][6] The expansion
        and
        cultural power of the British Empire allowed these rules of football to spread to areas of British influence
        outside
        the directly controlled empire.[7] By the end of the 19th century, distinct regional codes were already
        developing:
        Gaelic football, for example, deliberately incorporated the rules of local traditional football games in order
        to
        maintain their heritage.[8] In 1888, the Football League was founded in England, becoming the first of many
        professional football associations. During the 20th century, several of the various kinds of football grew to
        become
        some of the most popular team sports in the world.[9]

        The various codes of football share certain common elements and can be grouped into two main classes of
        football: carrying codes like American football, Canadian football, Australian football, rugby union and rugby
        league, where the ball is moved about the field while being held in the hands or thrown, and kicking codes such
        as association football and Gaelic football, where the ball is moved primarily with the feet, and where handling
        is strictly limited

        The Chinese competitive game cuju is an early type of ball game where feet were used, in some aspects resembling
        modern association football. It was possibly played around the Han dynasty and early Qin dynasty, based on an
        attestation in a military manual from around the second to third centuries BC.[15][16][17] In one version,
        gameplay consisted of players passing the ball between teammates without allowing it to touch the ground (much
        like keepie uppie). In its competitive version, two teams had to pass the ball without it falling, before
        kicking the ball through a circular hole placed in the middle of the pitch. Unlike association football, the two
        teams did not interact with each other but instead stayed on opposite sides of the pitch.[18] Cuju has been
        cited by FIFA as the earliest form of football.[4]
        The Japanese version of cuju is kemari (蹴鞠), and was developed during the Asuka period.[19] This is known to
        have been played within the Japanese imperial court in Kyoto from about 600 AD. In kemari, several people stand
        in a circle and kick a ball to each other, trying not to let the ball drop to the ground. The Silk Road
        facilitated the transmission of cuju, especially the game popular in the Tang dynasty, the period when the
        inflatable ball was invented and replaced the stuffed ball.[
